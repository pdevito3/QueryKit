# QueryKit 🎛️

QueryKit is a .NET library that makes it easier to query your data by providing a fluent and intuitive syntax for filtering and sorting. The main use case is a lighter weight subset of OData or GraphQL for parsing external filtering and sorting inputs to provide more granular consumption (e.g. a React UI provides filtering controls to filter a worklist). It's inspired by [Sieve](https://github.com/Biarity/Sieve), but with some differences.

## Getting Started

```bash
dotnet add package QueryKit
```

If we wanted to apply a filter to a `DbSet` called `People`, we just have to do something like this:

```c#
var filterInput = """FirstName == "Jane" && Age > 10""";
var people = _dbContext.People
  	.ApplyQueryKitFilter(filterInput)
  	.ToList();
```

QueryKit will automatically translate this into an expression for you. You can even customize your property names:

```c#
var filterInput = """first == "Jane" && Age > 10""";
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<Person>(x => x.FirstName).HasQueryName("first");
});
var people = _dbContext.People
  	.ApplyQueryKitFilter(filterInput, config)
  	.ToList();
```

Sorting works too:

```c#
var filterInput = """first == "Jane" && Age > 10""";
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<Person>(x => x.FirstName).HasQueryName("first");
});
var people = _dbContext.People
  	.ApplyQueryKitFilter(filterInput, config)
  	.ApplyQueryKitSort("first, Age desc", config)
  	.ToList();
```

And that's the basics! There's no services to inject or global set up to worry about, just apply what you want and call it a day. For a full list of capables, see below.

## Filtering

### Usage

To apply filters to your queryable, you just need to pass an input string with your filtering input to `ApplyQueryKitFilter` off of a queryable:

```c#
var people = _dbContext.People.ApplyQueryKitFilter("Age < 10").ToList();
```

You can also pass a configuration like this. More on configuration options below.

```c#
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<SpecialPerson>(x => x.FirstName)
     	 		.HasQueryName("first")
      		.PreventSort();
});
var people = _dbContext.People
  		.ApplyQueryKitFilter(@$"first == "Jane" && Age < 10", config)
  		.ToList();
```

### Logical Operators

When filtering, you can use logical operators `&&` for `and` as well as `||` for `or`. For example:

```c#
var input = """FirstName == "Jane" && Age < 10""";
var input = """FirstName == "Jane" || FirstName == "John" """;
```

### Order of Operations

You can use order of operation with parentheses like this:

```c#
var input = """(FirstName == "Jane" && Age < 10) || FirstName == "John" """;
```

### Comparison Operators

There's a wide variety of comparison operators that use the same base syntax as [Sieve](https://github.com/Biarity/Sieve)'s operators. To do a case-insensitive operation, just append a ` *` at the end of the operator.

| Name                  | Operator | Case Insensitive Operator | Count Operator |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Equals                | ==       | ==*                       | #==            |
| Not Equals            | !=       | !=*                       | #!=            |
| Greater Than          | >        | N/A                       | #>             |
| Less Than             | <        | N/A                       | #<             |
| Greater Than Or Equal | >=       | N/A                       | #>=            |
| Less Than Or Equal    | <=       | N/A                       | #<=            |
| Starts With           | _=       | _=*                       | N/A            |
| Does Not Start With   | !_=      | !_=*                      | N/A            |
| Ends With             | _-=      | _-=*                      | N/A            |
| Does Not End With     | !_-=     | !_-=*                     | N/A            |
| Contains              | @=       | @=*                       | N/A            |
| Does Not Contain      | !@=      | !@=*                      | N/A            |
| Sounds Like           | ~~       | N/A                       | N/A            |
| Does Not Sound Like   | !~       | N/A                       | N/A            |
| Has                   | ^$       | ^$*                       | N/A            |
| Does Not Have         | !^$      | !^$*                      | N/A            |
| In                    | ^^       | ^^*                       | N/A            |
| Not In                | !^^      | !^^*                      | N/A            |

> `Sounds Like` and `Does Not Sound Like` requires a soundex configuration on your DbContext. For more info see [the docs below](#soundex)

Here's an example for the `in` operator:

```c#
var input = """(Age ^^ [20, 30, 40]) && (BirthMonth ^^* ["January", "February", "March"]) || (Id ^^ ["6d623e92-d2cf-4496-a2df-f49fa77328ee"])""";
```

### Filtering Notes

* `string` and `guid` properties should be wrapped in double quotes

  * `null` doesn't need quotes: `var input = "Title == null";`

  * Double quotes can be escaped by using a similar syntax to raw-string literals introduced in C#11:

    ```c#
    var input = """""Title == """lamb is great on a "gee-ro" not a "gy-ro" sandwich""" """"";
    // OR 
    var input = """""""""Title == """"lamb is great on a "gee-ro" not a "gy-ro" sandwich"""" """"""""";
    ```

* Dates and times use ISO 8601 format and should be surrounded by double quotes:

  * `DateOnly`: `var filterInput = """Birthday == "2022-07-01" """;`
  * `DateTimeOffset`: 
    * `var filterInput = """Birthday == "2022-07-01T00:00:03Z" """;` 
  * `DateTime`: `var filterInput = """Birthday == "2022-07-01" """;`
    * `var filterInput = """Birthday == "2022-07-01T00:00:03" """;` 
    * `var filterInput = """Birthday == "2022-07-01T00:00:03+01:00" """;` 

  * `TimeOnly`: 
    * `var filterInput = """Time == "12:30:00" """;`
    * `var filterInput = """Time == "12:30:00.678722" """;`

* `bool` properties need to use `== true`, `== false`, or the same using the `!=` operator. they can not be standalone properies: 

  * ❌ `var input = """Title == "chicken & waffles" && Favorite""";` 
  * ✅ `var input = """Title == "chicken & waffles" && Favorite == true""";` 

#### Complex Example

```c#
var input = """(Title == "lamb" && ((Age >= 25 && Rating < 4.5) || (SpecificDate <= "2022-07-01T00:00:03Z" && Time == "00:00:03")) && (Favorite == true || Email.Value _= "hello@gmail.com"))""";
```

#### Filtering Collections

You can also filter into collections with QueryKit by using most of the normal operators. For example, if I wanted to filter for recipes that only have an ingredient named `salt`, I could do something like this:

```csharp
var input = """"Ingredients.Name == "salt" """";
```

By default, QueryKit will use `Any` under the hood when building this filter, but if you want to use `All`, you just need to prefix the operator with a `%`:

```csharp
var input = """"Ingredients.Stock %>= 1"""";
```

> 🚧 At the moment, nested collections like `Ingredients.Suppliers.Rating > 4` is still under active development

If you want to filter a primitve collection like `List<string>` you can use the `Has` or `DoesNotHave` operator (can be case insensitive with the appended `*`):

```csharp
var input = """Tags ^$ "winner" """;
// or
var input = """Tags !^$ "winner" """;
```

If you want to filter on the count of a collection, you can prefix some of the operators with a `#`. For example, if i wanted to get all recipes that have more than 0 ingredients:

```csharp
var input = """"Ingredients #>= 0"""";
```

#### Filtering Enums

You can filter enums with their respective integer value:

```csharp
var input = "BirthMonth == 1";

public enum BirthMonthEnum
{
    January = 1,
    February = 2,
	  //...
}
```

### Settings

#### Property Settings

Filtering is set up to create an expression using the property names you have on your entity, but you can pass in a config to customize things a bit when needed.

* `HasQueryName()` to create a custom alias for a property. For exmaple, we can make `FirstName` aliased to `first`.
* `PreventFilter()` to prevent filtering on a given property

```c#
var input = $"""first == "Jane" || Age > 10""";
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<SpecialPerson>(x => x.FirstName)
     	 		.HasQueryName("first");
    config.Property<SpecialPerson>(x => x.Age)
      		.PreventFilter();
});
```

#### Derived Properties

You can also expose custom derived properties for consumption. Just be sure that Linq can handle them in a db query if you're using it that way.

```csharp
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.DerivedProperty<Person>(p => p.FirstName + " " + p.LastName).HasQueryName("fullname");
    config.DerivedProperty<Person>(p => p.Age >= 18 && p.FirstName == "John").HasQueryName("adult_johns");
});

var input = $"""(fullname @=* "John Doe") && age >= 18""";
// or
var input = $"""adult_johns == true""";
```

#### Custom Operators

You can also add custom comparison operators to your config if you'd like:
```csharp
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.EqualsOperator = "@@$";
    config.CaseInsensitiveAppendix = "$";
    config.AndOperator = "and";
});
```

If you want to use it globally, you can make a base implementation like this:

```csharp
public class CustomQueryKitConfiguration : QueryKitConfiguration
{
    public CustomQueryKitConfiguration(Action<QueryKitSettings>? configureSettings = null)
        : base(settings => 
        {
            settings.EqualsOperator = "eq";
            settings.NotEqualsOperator = "neq";
            settings.GreaterThanOperator = "gt";
            settings.GreaterThanOrEqualOperator = "gte";
            settings.LessThanOperator = "lt";
            settings.LessThanOrEqualOperator = "lte";
            settings.ContainsOperator = "ct";
            settings.StartsWithOperator = "sw";
            settings.EndsWithOperator = "ew";
            settings.NotContainsOperator = "nct";
            settings.NotStartsWithOperator = "nsw";
            settings.NotEndsWithOperator = "new";
            settings.AndOperator = "and";
            settings.OrOperator = "or";
            settings.CaseInsensitiveAppendix = "i";

            configureSettings?.Invoke(settings);
        })
    {
    }
}

// ---

var input = """Title eq$ "Pancakes" and Rating gt 10""";
var config = new CustomQueryKitConfiguration();
var filterExpression = FilterParser.ParseFilter<Recipe>(input, config);
```

> **Note**
> Spaces must be used around the comparison operator when using custom values.
> `Title @@$ "titilating"` ✅ 
> `Title@@$"titilating"` ❌

#### Allow Unknown Properties

By default, QueryKit will throw an error if it doesn't recognize a property name, If you want to loosen the reigns here a bit, you can set `AllowUnknownProperties` to `true` in your config. When active, unknown properties will be ignored in the expression resolution.
```csharp
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.AllowUnknownProperties = true;
});
var filterExpression = FilterParser.ParseFilter<Recipe>(input, config);
```

### Nested Objects

Say we have a nested object like this:

```C#

public class SpecialPerson
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; } = Guid.NewGuid();
    public EmailAddress Email { get; set; }
}

public class EmailAddress : ValueObject
{
    public EmailAddress(string? value)
    {
        Value = value;
    }
    
    public string? Value { get; private set; }
}
```

To actually use the nested properties, you can do something like this:

```c#
var input = $"""Email.Value == "{value}" """;

// or with an alias...
var input = $"""email == "hello@gmail.com" """;
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<SpecialPerson>(x => x.Email.Value).HasQueryName("email");
});
```

Note, with EF core, your config might look like this:

```c#
public sealed class PersonConfiguration : IEntityTypeConfiguration<SpecialPerson>
{
    public void Configure(EntityTypeBuilder<SpecialPerson> builder)
    {
        builder.HasKey(x => x.Id);
      
      	// Option 1 (as of .NET 8)
      	builder.ComplexProperty(x => x.Email,
            x => x.Property(y => y.Value)
                .HasColumnName("email")); 
      
      	// Option 2
        builder.Property(x => x.Email)
            .HasConversion(x => x.Value, x => new EmailAddress(x))
            .HasColumnName("email");      
      
        // Option 3   
        builder.OwnsOne(x => x.Email, opts =>
        {
            opts.Property(x => x.Value).HasColumnName("email");
        }).Navigation(x => x.Email)
            .IsRequired();
    }
}
```

> **Warning**
> EF properties configured with `HasConversion` are not supported at this time

## Sorting

Sorting is a more simplistic flow. It's just an input with a comma delimited list of properties to sort by. 

### Rules

* use `asc` or `desc` to designate if you want it to be ascending or descending. If neither is used, QueryKit will assume `asc`
* You can use Sieve syntax as well by prefixing a property with `-` to designate it as `desc`
* Spaces after commas are optional

So all of these are valid:

```c#
var input = "Title";
var input = "Title, Age desc";
var input = "Title desc, Age desc";
var input = "Title, Age";
var input = "Title asc, -Age";
var input = "Title, -Age";
```

### Property Settings

Sorting is set up to create an expression using the property names you have on your entity, but you can pass in a config to customize things a bit when needed.

* Just as with filtering, `HasQueryName()` to create a custom alias for a property. For exmaple, we can make `FirstName` aliased to `first`.
* `PreventSort()` to prevent filtering on a given property

```c#
var input = $"""Age desc, first"";
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<SpecialPerson>(x => x.FirstName)
          .HasQueryName("first")
          .PreventSort();
});
```

## Aggregate QueryKit Application

If you want to apply filtering and sorting in one fell swoop, you can do something like this:

```csharp
var config = new QueryKitConfiguration(config =>
{
    config.Property<Person>(x => x.FirstName).HasQueryName("first");
});
var people = _dbContext.People
  	.ApplyQueryKit(new QueryKitData() 
        {
            Filters = """first == "Jane" && Age > 10""",
            SortOrder = "first, Age desc",
            Configuration = config
        })
  	.ToList();
```



## Error Handling

If you want to capture errors to easily throw a `400`, you can add error handling around these exceptions:

* A `QueryKitException` is the base class for all of the exceptions listed below. This can be caught to catch
any exception thrown by QueryKit.
* A `ParsingException` will be thrown when there is an invalid operator or bad syntax is used (e.g. not using double quotes around a string or guid).
* An `UnknownFilterPropertyException` will be thrown if a property is not recognized during filtering
* A `SortParsingException` will be thrown if a property or operation is not recognized during sorting
* A `QueryKitDbContextTypeException` will be thrown when trying to use a `DbContext` specific workflow without passing that context (e.g. SoundEx)
* A `SoundsLikeNotImplementedException` will be thrown when trying to use `soundex` on a `DbContext` that doesn't have it implemented.
* A `QueryKitParsingException` is a more generic error that will include specific details on a more granular error in the parsing pipeline.

## SoundEx

The `Sounds Like` and `Does Not Sound Like` operators require a soundex configuration on any `DbContext` that contain your `DbSet` being filtered on. Something like the below should work. The `SoundsLike` method does not need to implement anything and is just used as a pointer to the db method.

```csharp
public class ExampleDbContext : DbContext
{
    public ExampleDbContext(DbContextOptions<TestingDbContext> options)
        : base(options)
    {
    }
    
    [DbFunction (Name = "SOUNDEX", IsBuiltIn = true)]
    public static string SoundsLike(string query) => throw new NotImplementedException();

    public DbSet<People> MyPeople { get; set; }
    
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
        modelBuilder.HasPostgresExtension("fuzzystrmatch");
    }
}
```

> ⭐️ Note that with Postgres, something like `modelBuilder.HasPostgresExtension("fuzzystrmatch");` will need to be added like the example along with a migration for adding the extension.

You can even use this on a normal `IQueryable` like this: 
```csharp
var waffleRecipes = _dbContext.MyPeople
  .Where(x => ExampleDbContext.SoundsLike(x.LastName) == ExampleDbContext.SoundsLike("devito"))
  .ToList();
```

### Usage

Once your `DbContext` is configured to allow soundex, you'll need to provide that `DbContext` type in your QueryKit config. This is because, as of now, there is no reliable way to get the `DbContext` from an `IQueryable`.

```csharp
var input = $"""LastName ~~ "devito" """;

// Act
var queryablePeople = testingServiceScope.DbContext().People;
var appliedQueryable = queryablePeople.ApplyQueryKitFilter(input, new QueryKitConfiguration(o =>
{
    o.DbContextType = typeof(TestingDbContext);
}));
var people = await appliedQueryable.ToListAsync();
```
